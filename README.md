<h3>...through bug reporting:</h3>
Create an issue on GitHub and prefix it with "[BUG]". So your issue should look something like "[BUG] All files are pictures of cats.". The label "bug" will be added by contributors if it is considered a bug.

<h3>...through feature-requests:</h3>
If you have a feature request, feel free to share it with us in an issue!

<h3>...through documentation:</h3>
As of now, the repository is not that big. Documentation is not that relevant right now.
<b>Later down the road</b> a documentation file will be added and also this text will be updated.
